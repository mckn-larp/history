# The Garou in Knoxville (Player Guide)

## Summary

The Garou of Eastern Tennessee are locked in a spiritual and physical war against the **Wyrm**, fighting to protect their **caerns**, sacred sites, and Gaia herself. They’ve struck an uneasy **alliance with the Sabbat**, ceding ground to hold a buffer zone between their territories and the corrupted lands of **Oak Ridge**. While practical, the alliance has created divisions, especially among younger Garou questioning the cost of compromise.

You are one of Gaia’s warriors. Your pack is your family. The Wyrm is your enemy. And the battle is far from over.

## Where the Garou Hold Ground

### Septs and Sacred Sites

- **The Sept of the Sentinel**  
  Deep in the **Great Smoky Mountains National Park**, this sept is guarded by **Uktena** and **Wendigo**. It's one of the region’s oldest caerns and a source of tremendous spiritual power.

- **The Sept of the Sacred Stone**  
  South of **Adams Mill**, this caern is protected by the **Black Furies**, focused on preserving Gaia’s beauty and sacredness. Threatened by industrial projects tied to the Wyrm.

- **The Sept of the Green Mountain**  
  Near **LaFollette, Tennessee**, this sept borders **Kentucky** and is watched by both **Get of Fenris** and **Children of Gaia**. A critical northern defense post.

- **The Sept of the Broken Spear**  
  Located near **Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary**, this caern fell to the Wyrm in **2020**. Its loss deepened tension between Fenrir and Children of Gaia, who now work apart more often than together.

## Pack Presence and Goals

Garou packs are spread across rural Appalachia, using forests, mountains, and valleys as both home and battlefield.

**Notable packs include:**  
*(Note: Ask ST for active packs and join opportunities.)*

## Named Garou Packs of Eastern Tennessee

- **The Serpent's Spine**  
  Tied to the **Uktena**, this pack guards old ley lines deep in the Smoky Mountains. Their rituals and knowledge of forgotten magic protect the spiritual arteries of Gaia from corruption.

- **Grove's Edge**  
  Fierce **Black Fury** and other female warriors who dwell near long-lost sacred groves. They act as defenders of the land’s most vulnerable places, striking swiftly against those who would defile them.

- **The Hollow Peace**  
  Composed mostly of **Children of Gaia**, this pack seeks to keep peace between the tribes. They serve as spiritual counselors, diplomats, and—when necessary—unflinching judges in times of conflict.

- **Whisperwinds**  
  An odd union of **Wendigo** and **Silent Striders**, this scout pack watches Oak Ridge from the edges of the Umbra and the mortal world alike. They are unseen messengers, tracking both danger and opportunity.

- **Ironhowl**  
  Primarily **Get of Fenris**, this pack is the first into the fight. They operate as shock troops on the frontlines of the war against the Wyrm, often sacrificing safety for overwhelming force.

- **Ember Vein**  
  Made up of kinfolk operatives and several **Fianna** Garou who blend into mortal life, **Ember Vein** manipulates and sabotages Wyrm-touched industries from within. Their influence in corporate and civic structures is as precise as it is deadly.

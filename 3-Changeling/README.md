# Changelings of Eastern Tennessee

[← Back to History](../README.md)  

-----
## Presence in the Region

Changelings in Eastern Tennessee come in two broad groups: the Nunnehi (Native American Fae) and European-descended Seelie and Unseelie Courts. The Nunnehi are spiritual guardians rooted in Cherokee traditions, operating in natural sites like Cades Cove, Abrams Creek, and the Great Smoky Mountains. They protect sacred places, maintain harmony between realms, and fight corruption—particularly that of the Wyrm and Technocracy.

European Changelings are concentrated in Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. The Seelie focus on gathering Glamour from art and creativity, blending into the local tourism economy. The Unseelie tap into darker emotions like ambition and regret, working from the shadows of commercial excess.

## Freeholds and Trods

### Notable Freeholds

- **Hidden Valleys Freehold (Nunnehi)**: Deep in the Smoky Mountains, this is the heart of the Nunnehi’s spiritual defense. Rituals, spirit communication, and leadership come from here.
- **Green Glens Freehold (Nunnehi)**: Located near Abrams Creek. Once overrun, it's being reclaimed with help from the Garou.
- **Whispering Pines Freehold (Seelie)**: Hidden among the artistic communities of Pigeon Forge. Glamour flows through music, creativity, and nature.
- **Silver Mist Freehold (Unseelie)**: Found in the neglected corners of Pigeon Forge, fueled by dark glamour, ambition, and dissatisfaction.

### Important Trods

- **Trod of Lost Tears**: A sacred, emotionally resonant path through the Smokies tied to Cherokee spirits. Powerful, but dangerous to outsiders.
- **Trod of the Shrouded Oak**: Located in Cherokee National Forest, this path offers visions and spiritual insight, heavily guarded by the Nunnehi.
- **Bright Way**: Runs near Gatlinburg. Contested by Seelie and Unseelie Courts.
- **Falling Shadows Trod**: Used by the Unseelie to move through the Dreaming and between cities. Dangerous for non-Unseelie.

## Faction Goals

### Nunnehi

- Defend sacred places from the Wyrm, Technocracy, and rival Changelings.
- Maintain spiritual harmony across the Umbra, Dreaming, and real world.
- Reclaim and protect broken or corrupted Freeholds and trods.

### Seelie Court

- Gather Glamour through tourism, art, and creativity.
- Preserve natural beauty while promoting cultural experiences.
- Hold onto Freeholds and contest Unseelie influence.

### Unseelie Court

- Expand dark glamour sources through human desire and frustration.
- Undermine rivals and seize control of contested trods.
- Use power to reshape the Dreaming to their advantage.

## Allies and Enemies

- **Uktena Garou**: Especially close to the Nunnehi. They share spiritual duties and work together to stop the Wyrm.
- **Dreamspeakers and Verbena Mages**: Join Nunnehi in rituals to maintain balance and fight corruption.
- **Local Artists**: Seelie Court often supports and collaborates with mortals to fuel the Dreaming.

**Enemies**

## Major Events

## Key Figures

## Themes and Tone

- **Political**: A three-way struggle between Nunnehi spiritual guardianship, Seelie diplomacy, and Unseelie ambition.
- **Social**: Deep divisions between native and European Changelings, compounded by cultural misunderstanding and magical priorities.
- **Economic**: Glamour is the lifeblood. Tourism, performance, and spiritual rites all fuel the Dreaming in different ways.
- **Religious and Spiritual**:
  - **Nunnehi**: Ancestral, land-based spirituality and moral duty.
  - **Seelie**: Romantic ideals of beauty and nobility.
  - **Unseelie**: Power-focused, morally ambiguous manipulation of dreams and fears.

## For Players

- If you play a **Nunnehi**, expect deep spiritual responsibilities and strong ties to Garou and mages. Defending the land is your life’s work.
- If you play a **Seelie**, you’re balancing cultural preservation, glamour collection, and diplomacy. You inspire dreams and protect beauty.
- If you play an **Unseelie**, power comes from embracing darker truths. You exploit, manipulate, and move behind the scenes.

Changelings in this chronicle live between myth and memory, with ancient pathways at risk and modern ambition pressing in. Whether defending the past, shaping the present, or pursuing their own shadowy futures, the Fae of Eastern Tennessee walk a narrow path between wonder and war.

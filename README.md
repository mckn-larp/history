# Player Brief: Knoxville & Eastern Tennessee

---

**Date:** *2025-JUL-10*  
**Version:** *1.0.5 - Ashfall Shiver Thorn*

## What You Need to Know

Eastern Tennessee is a **hotbed of supernatural conflict**. Three major powers—**Garou (werewolves), Sabbat (vampires), and the Wyrm (a corrupting cosmic force)**—are locked in a cold war that’s starting to heat up. Everyone else—Wraiths, Changelings, Mages, Hunters—are being pulled into the crossfire.

### The Deal with Knoxville
The Garou gave up **Knoxville** to the Sabbat in exchange for help holding off the Wyrm in Oak Ridge. It’s a devil’s bargain. While it’s created a buffer, it’s also sparked **internal conflict** on both sides, with whispers of betrayal and compromise.

## Key Factions

## [Sabbat](./1-Sabbat/README.md)

The Sabbat control **Knoxville** and its immediate surrounds, having ousted rival Kindred with brutal force. While deeply divided internally, their shared goal is clear: fortify their power, defend against the Wyrm’s advance from **Oak Ridge**, and eventually purge the Garou—despite the current uneasy alliance.

### Key Places
- **Old City Underground**: Site of bloody Esbats and dark rituals beneath the streets of Knoxville.
- **Ijams Nature Center – Mead’s Quarry**: Claimed for spiritual resonance. Used for Sabbat mysticism and public executions.
- **Abandoned L&N Station**: Now a war council hall. Some believe it’s haunted.
- **University of Tennessee**: A Sabbat infiltration site—used for feeding, research, and recruiting.
- **Industrial District**: Heavily fortified. Also houses bunkers and Sabbat havens.

### Goals
- **Fortify Knoxville** as a spiritual and military stronghold.
- **Push back the Wyrm** in Oak Ridge—only to later conquer the territory for themselves.
- **Undermine the Garou alliance** once it no longer serves their needs.
- **Consolidate power internally** through Esbats, blood rituals, and trials by combat.
- **Exploit mortal systems**—industries, corruption, and black market control.

### For Players
- The Sabbat are monsters—but they’re your monsters. You fight for survival and dominance.
- Trust is fleeting. Power is earned in blood and fire.
- Public loyalty hides private schemes. Play politics carefully.
- Religious fervor is real: your war is reail, and **Knoxville is sacred ground**.
- Expect inner conflict: balancing defense against the Wyrm with the drive to subvert the Garou compact.

## [Garou](./2-Garou/README.md)

The **Garou** defend what’s left of Gaia in Eastern Tennessee. They protect **rural caerns**, battle the **Wyrm's corruption** in Oak Ridge, and maintain a tense alliance with the Sabbat. But the cost of that alliance weighs heavily on their spirits.

### Key Places
- **Sept of the Sentinel** (Smoky Mountains): Defended by **Uktena** and **Wendigo**, this caern is sacred and fiercely guarded.
- **Sept of the Sacred Stone** (Wolf Creek): A **Black Fury** stronghold, tied to feminine spiritual power and ancient rites.
- **Sept of Green Mountain** (Anderson County Park): Run jointly by **Get of Fenris** and **Children of Gaia**, this site balances war and peace.
- **Sept of the Broken Spear** (Brushy Mountain): Now **lost to the Wyrm**—a cautionary tale and potential battlefield.
- **Umbra Veins**: Thin spots in the Gauntlet near old mining sites, sometimes used to stage spiritual counterattacks.

### Goals
- **Protect sacred land** and kinfolk from industrial corruption.
- **Combat the Wyrm** in Oak Ridge through raids and rites.
- **Preserve spiritual balance**, even as spirits grow twisted.
- **Monitor and control the Sabbat alliance**, watching for betrayal.
- **Heal the damage**—physical and spiritual—caused by modern encroachment and recent compromises.

### For Players
- You are Gaia’s warriors, but your honor is tested.
- The Wyrm is not your only enemy. Politics and doubt erode your unity.
- Expect rites, moral choices, and spiritual warfare.
- Pack ties matter—survival often depends on your chosen family.
- Some want to end the alliance with the Sabbat. Others want to double down. Where do you stand?

## [Changeling](./3-Changeling/README.md)

The Fae live in the cracks of the world—between reality and dreams. In Eastern Tennessee, **Changelings** are scattered across mountain hollows, tourist traps, and ancient groves. They see the Wyrm’s rise as an existential threat, and many are starting to fight back.

### Key Groups:
- **Nunnehi**: Native spirits tied to Cherokee traditions. Protectors of sacred places like **Cade’s Cove** and **Abrams Creek**. They don’t trust outsiders—especially the European fae.
- **Seelie Court**: Operate out of **Pigeon Forge**. Feed on creativity and beauty. Host festivals, music jams, and art collectives.
- **Unseelie Court**: Work behind the scenes in **Gatlinburg**, exploiting tourism, greed, and ambition. Glamour through chaos.

### What Changelings Want:
- **Nunnehi**: Preserve sacred spaces and repel industrial expansion.
- **Seelie**: Promote beauty, imagination, and creative power.
- **Unseelie**: Thrive off darker emotions—desire, sorrow, and rage.

### What You Might See:
- Glamour-feeding off tourists.
- Disputed **trods** (magical paths between worlds).
- Changelings turning to **Garou and Mages** for allies—or to **hunters** to strike at rivals.

## [Wraith](./4-Wraith/README.md)

Eastern Tennessee is haunted—literally. **Wraiths** tied to war, genocide, and forgotten tragedies linger in the **Shadowlands**, struggling to move on. Some want peace. Some want revenge. All are caught in a spiritual war.

### Key Necropoli (Ghost Cities):
- **Cade’s Cove**: Native and settler ghosts hold the line against Wyrm spirits.
- **Old St. Mary’s Hospital** (Knoxville): Trauma echoes through every hallway.
- **Oak Ridge**: Overrun by **Spectres**—wraiths twisted by Wyrm corruption.

### Wraith Goals:
- **Protect the Shadowlands** from the Wyrm.
- **Finish their business** so they can move on.
- **Avoid being used** by vampires or destroyed by Garou rites.

### For Players:
- Wraiths may offer help—or warnings.
- Some Garou and Mages rely on them for spiritual insight.
- But not all ghosts are friendly… and not all spirits want balance.

## [Mage](./5-Mage/README.md)

**Mages** tap into raw reality. In Tennessee, the war between the Technocracy and the Traditions is boiling under the surface.

### Factions:
- **Traditions**: Mostly **Verbena** and **Dreamspeakers** working with nature, spirits, and the Umbra. Protect sacred spaces.
- **Technocracy**: Focused on **Oak Ridge**, pushing Enlightened Science through tech and industry.
- **Disparates & Hollow Ones**: Lone actors and rogue mystics. Some hunt artifacts, others keep low profiles.

### What Mages Want:
- **Traditions**: Stop the Technocracy. Restore spiritual balance.
- **Technocracy**: Control the narrative. Use science to "protect" reality—even if it means burning down the old ways.
- **Others**: Stay hidden, find lost knowledge, or ride the chaos.

### Key Sites:
- **Hidden Reactor**: Technocratic node near Kingston.
- **Forest of Distant Echoes**: Horizon Realm hidden in Cherokee forest.
- **The Lodge of Black River**: Verbena chantry near Douglas Lake.

## [Hunter](./6-Hunter/README.md)

Hunters don’t always understand what they’re fighting—but they fight anyway. Some are zealots. Some are scholars. Some are just regular folks pushed too far.

### Groups in the Region:
- **Vigil Keepers**: Rural defenders. Traditional, faith-based, and tight-knit.
- **Order of the Holy Flame**: Militant. Sees everything supernatural as evil.
- **Lantern Society**: Scholars and investigators. Look for balance, not eradication.
- **Project Blackthorn**: Government-funded operatives. National security over morality.

### What Hunters Want:
- **Survival**.
- **Truth**.
- **To protect their families**.

### Conflicts Brewing:
- Some hunters know about the **Garou-Sabbat alliance** and want to break it.
- Others see the Wyrm as the true enemy.
- Blackthorn is beginning to identify **Oak Ridge** as the epicenter of something catastrophic.

## [Cosmology](./7-Cosmology/README.md)

Eastern Tennessee is **fractured across veils**, where supernatural geography bleeds into the mundane. Below are the **notable metaphysical features** that shape the region’s spiritual reality:

### Umbra (Spirit World)
- **Gauntlet Thickness**: Varies wildly—**thin** near ancient groves and caerns, **thick** in industrial zones like Oak Ridge.
- **Twisted Umbra**: Around Oak Ridge and TVA facilities, the Umbra is corrupted. Spirits appear mutated, pain-sick, or half-metal.
- **Lodges & Spirit Havens**:
  - *Smoky Mountain Veins*: Natural “veins” of spiritual power run deep under the Smokies. Dreamspeakers, Uktena, and Nunnehi use them for long-range rituals.
  - *Brushy Mountain Scar*: A rift created when the Sept of the Broken Spear fell. A spiritual sinkhole now oozes banes and sorrow-spirits.

### Shadowlands (Land of the Dead)
- **Bleed Points**: 
  - *Old St. Mary’s Hospital* in Knoxville and *White Oak Flats Cemetery* in Gatlinburg, Tennessee are thinned places where Wraiths cross easier.
- **Spectral Taint**: Shadowlands around Oak Ridge shimmer with radiation scars and sorrow-echoes. Even Spectres hesitate here.

### The Dreaming
- **Trods**:
  - *Abrams Creek* to *Cade’s Cove*: A Nunnehi-guarded Trod to the Dreaming, long protected but now weakened by mortal tourism.
  - *Gatlinburg Mirrorlight*: A hidden Trod through art galleries, carnival mirrors, and vintage souvenir shops. The Seelie and Unseelie use this as a route to Freeholds.
- **Freehold Flux**: The Dreaming reflects the land's turmoil. Glamour-rich trods become choked with banality when mortals desecrate sacred places.

### Digital Web
- **The TVA Nexus**: Oak Ridge’s Technocratic constructs anchor an entropic firewall here. The Digital Web is fragmented and glitchy nearby.
- **Data-Wyrm Infection**: Rumors of corrupted constructs “possessed” by Wyrm-code run rampant near DOE and ex-nuclear networks.

### Horizon & Deep Umbra
- **The Forest of Distant Echoes**: A **Verbena** Horizon Realm tucked into Cherokee National Forest. Time moves strangely here; dreams become tangible.
- **Wyld Shards**: Slivers of Deep Umbra drift down through old ley lines in the mountains. They're unstable but potent with pure Wyld energy—sought by Garou, feared by Mages.

### Key Regional Oddities
- **Cloaked Caerns**: Hidden sanctums exist that can only be found during eclipses or lunar conjunctions. Many are protected by ancestor-spirits or bound wyrdlings.
- **Shifting Gauntlets**: In areas of trauma or intense memory (battlefields, desecrated holy sites), the Gauntlet “breathes,” thinning and thickening with emotional resonance.
- **Echo-Walkers**: Strange entities that move *between* veils. They resemble afterimages of people who died violently or beings that slipped through during Maelstrom tears.

> **Reminder for Players:** Most supernatural beings are aware of *one layer*—those who can see beyond often pay a price. The veils here are thin, but not forgiving.

## Themes to Expect

- **Nature vs Industry**: Think sacred groves vs toxic factories.
- **Bargains and Betrayals**: Alliances with dark costs.
- **Territory Control**: Constant turf wars.
- **Corruption**: Spiritual and moral.
- **Isolation and Community**: Survival means knowing who you can trust.
- **Haunted Past**: This land remembers.
- **Mortal Complication**: Some humans are waking up to the truth.

## What Your Character Knows

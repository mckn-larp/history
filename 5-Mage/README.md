# Mages of Eastern Tennessee

---

## Overview

Eastern Tennessee is a magical battleground. The region is steeped in spiritual history and humming with ley lines and nodes that both empower and endanger. Mages of all stripes—Traditions, Technocrats, Disparates—vie for control, each with their own agendas and allies.

The rural expanse, ancient forests, and post-industrial shadows are home to chantries, covert labs, and unseen realms. From the winding trails of Cherokee National Forest to the radiation-laced labs beneath Oak Ridge, power lies buried in the land—and mages are determined to claim it.

### Mage Presence

- **Traditions:** Especially strong among the Verbena, Dreamspeakers, and Celestial Chorus (Choristers). They align with Garou and wraiths to preserve spiritual integrity and resist both Technocracy and Wyrm corruption.
- **Technocracy:** Operates out of Oak Ridge and Kingston, focusing on industrial and scientific control via Iteration X and the New World Order.
- **Disparates & Hollow Ones:** Secretive, decentralized, and often apolitical. They navigate between Tradition and Technocratic influence, seeking to survive and uncover Appalachia’s forgotten occult roots.

### Horizon Realms

- **Forest of Distant Echoes (Traditions):** A nature-dominant realm accessed via Cherokee National Forest. Home to ancient spirit beings and timeless primal power.

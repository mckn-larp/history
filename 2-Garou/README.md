# The Garou of Eastern Tennessee

---

## Summary

The Garou of Eastern Tennessee are **warriors of spirit and fang**, bound to a land that bleeds both beauty and corruption.  
For generations, they have fought to defend **Gaia’s sacred sites**—the caerns—from the insidious reach of the **Wyrm**.  
Now, they face a war on two fronts: battling ancient corruption leaking from the festering wound of **Oak Ridge**, and struggling with the uneasy truce they've forged with an unlikely ally—the **Sabbat vampires**.

This "agreement", born of desperate necessity, has driven a wedge into Garou society.  
Younger Garou question whether survival is worth the cost of compromise.  
Elders cling to the belief that the greater war demands sacrifice, even if it means standing beside once-hated enemies.

**You are one of Gaia’s chosen.**  
You are born into war, bred for the defense of the sacred, and fated to carry the weight of ancient duty.  
Your pack is your shield, your spirit is your weapon, and your enemy—whether Wyrm-tainted beast, corrupted mortal, or untrustworthy ally—is everywhere.

**The battle is far from over. The burden now falls to you.**

## Where the Garou Hold Ground

### Septs and Sacred Sites

- **The Sept of the Sentinel**  
  Reawakened in **early 2017** following the devastating **Chimney Top 2 fires**, the Sept of the Sentinel now stands as a powerful Wyld-aligned caern on the **western edge of Great Smoky Mountains National Park**.  
  Once a dormant site of deep Uktena and Wendigo history, the caern has been reborn under the guidance of newly awakened spirits, and is now **open to all tribes** who seek to defend Gaia’s wild soul.  
  The fire that ravaged the forest also peeled back the spiritual layers of the land, allowing a potent Wyld spirit to surge forth and reclaim its place.  
  While old traditions linger, the sept now thrives with inclusivity and renewal, serving as both sanctuary and staging ground for spiritual warriors, vision seekers, and caern defenders.  
  Its eastern counterpart, the **Sept of the Changing Seasons**, continues to guard the park's opposite flank, in careful "agreement".

- **The Sept of the Sacred Stone**  
  Located south of **Wolf Creek**, this sept lies amid rolling hills and ancient groves.  
  Tended by the **Black Furies**, it represents a fierce defense of Gaia's natural beauty against creeping industrialization. Sacred groves, untouched streams, and hidden moonlit clearings serve as places of worship, defense, and training.  
  However, corporate expansion tied to Wyrm-tainted industries now threatens the borders of this sacred ground.

- **The Sept of the Green Mountain**  
  Nestled near **Anderson County Park & Norris Lake, Tennessee**, the Green Mountain Sept stands as a critical northern watchpost.  
  It is guarded by an uneasy "agreement" between the **Get of Fenris** and the **Children of Gaia**, who work together to protect the caern despite deep ideological differences.  
  Here, strength and diplomacy must exist side by side, though tensions run high after past failures.

- **The Sept of the Changing Seasons**  
  Nestled atop **Blanket Mountain**, this sept lies within the Tennessee side of the **Great Smoky Mountains National Park**, near Gatlinburg.  
  It is a **healing caern** of considerable power, marked by its ties to the **Fianna**, **Silver Fangs**, and **Children of Gaia**, who jointly administer the site.  
  The sept focuses on spiritual renewal and protection of sacred places, including efforts to reintegrate native wolf populations and safeguard the land from overdevelopment and spiritual decay.  
  Due to the park's visibility and heavy tourist presence, the Garou must navigate their sacred duties while mitigating threats from pollution, encroachment, and mundane attention.  
  The caern’s heart lies in a sacred glade near a spring pool where the totem **Salamander** once appeared in answer to a vision quest.  
  The sept actively monitors supernatural activity across the eastern edge of the park, balancing its spiritual mission with quiet vigilance against the Wyrm and Weaver alike.

- **The Sept of the Broken Spear**  
  North of the infamous **Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary**, this once-proud caern fell to the Wyrm in **2020**.  
  The loss haunts the Garou still. Its fall divided the Fenrir and the Children of Gaia even further, sowing distrust that lingers even in council and moot.  
  The land around Broken Spear is tainted and dangerous, patrolled only by the most battle-hardened or desperate Garou.

**Territorial Overview**

The Garou of Eastern Tennessee hold rural lands, vast forests, remote mountains, and sacred rivers.  
While cities are mostly avoided or infiltrated through kinfolk proxies, the wilderness belongs to the Garou — and they defend it with tooth, claw, and spirit.

Every caern is a sanctuary.  
Every mountain trail could lead to battle.  
Every quiet glade could become a last stand.

## Pack Presence and Goals

Garou packs are scattered throughout the sprawling forests, rocky mountains, and misty valleys of Eastern Tennessee.  
These packs are more than warbands — they are families, spiritual circles, and guardians of Gaia's last untouched places.

Each pack holds its own territory, sacred duties, and spiritual focus.  
They range from lone sentinels defending ancient ley lines to strike teams sabotaging Wyrm-corrupted industries.  
No matter their methods, all serve the greater war against corruption.

Packs operate with limited resources and must rely on kinfolk, old pacts with spirits, and mortal covers to maintain their vigilance.  
Secrecy, adaptability, and tenacity define survival.

**Notable Goals of the Regional Packs**

- **Defend existing caerns** against spiritual decay and mortal encroachment.
- **Patrol border zones** near Oak Ridge, ensuring the Wyrm's influence does not spread unchecked.
- **Recruit new Garou and kinfolk**, ensuring the future of the Garou Nation.
- **Balance tradition and innovation**, preparing younger Garou to inherit a world very different from the one their elders knew.
- **Monitor the Sabbat "agreement"**, watching for inevitable betrayal while leveraging it for short-term gains.
- **Reclaim lost territories**, with long-term goals to purify or retake sites like the Sept of the Broken Spear.

**Note for Players:**  
If you are creating a new character or joining the chronicle, ask the Storytellers about active packs looking for members.  
Alternatively, forge your own legend by founding a new pack under the watchful eyes of the Garou Nation.

## What You Need to Know as a Player

### Your Job in the Story

You are a Garou — a warrior born under Gaia's sacred light, chosen to protect what little purity remains in a dying world.

You are expected to:

- **Fight the Wyrm, spiritually and physically.**  
  Every hunt, every ritual, every battle is a stand against corruption. No enemy is too small, and no threat can be ignored.

- **Guard the Caerns and Uphold the Litany.**  
  The caerns are Gaia's last refuges, and the Litany is the law that holds the Garou Nation together. Breaking faith with either brings dishonor and death.

- **Balance Tradition and Adaptation in a Changing World.**  
  The old ways are sacred, but survival sometimes demands new tactics.  
  Garou must find a way to honor the past without dooming the future.

- **Endure the Spiritual Cost of the Sabbat "agreement" — or Fight It.**  
  Not all Garou accept the truce with the vampires.  
  Some endure it out of necessity. Others burn with rage at the compromise.  
  Your stance will define your character's place within the Nation.

**Survival Tip:**  
No Garou stands alone.  
Your pack is your shield, your heart, and your future. Without them, you are already dead.

## For Players: Themes to Explore

### Political Themes

- **Leadership Struggles Over the Sabbat "Agreement"**  
  The "agreement" with the Sabbat has fractured old loyalties and ignited new political fires.  
  Elders argue for survival above all else. Younger Garou question whether survival at the cost of honor is worth anything at all.

- **Tensions Between Generations**  
  Young Garou see a world slipping away.  
  They challenge traditional methods and question the wisdom of those who forged the "agreement".  
  Elders see them as reckless children who do not understand the cost of war.

- **Negotiations with Mortals and Supernaturals**  
  Battles are not fought with tooth and claw alone.  
  Mortals, spirits, and other supernatural beings influence the region.  
  Territory must be protected, but so must political "agreement"s and ancient pacts.

### Social Themes

- **Pack Bonds as Family**  
  In a world teetering on the brink of spiritual collapse, your pack is everything.  
  Trust is not given lightly, but once earned, it is the bedrock of survival.

- **Isolation vs Cooperation**  
  Some tribes prefer isolation. Others advocate unity against a shared enemy.  
  Every Garou must navigate where they stand in the growing divide.

- **The Cost of Survival**  
  The "agreement" with the Sabbat is a wound on the Nation's spirit.  
  Every Garou must decide what sacrifices they are willing to make—and what lines they refuse to cross.

### Economic Themes

- **Sabotage and Subversion**  
  Garou fight Wyrm-touched industries not just with claws, but with sabotage, manipulation, and kinfolk infiltration.  
  The battlefield includes boardrooms and back alleys as much as it does the wilderness.

- **Kinfolk Networks**  
  Kinfolk-run businesses supply resources, intelligence, and influence.  
  Protecting them is vital—and sometimes means operating in the mortal world more than the Umbra.

- **Materialism vs Duty**  
  Garou despise the Wyrm's material corruption, but they cannot fight without weapons, shelters, and supplies.  
  Balancing disdain for mortal trappings with the need to survive is an ongoing struggle.

### Religious Themes

- **Sacred Duties to Gaia**  
  Every ritual, every moot, every hunt is an act of worship and devotion.  
  The Garou were created to protect Gaia—and nothing must supersede that duty.

- **Caerns as Churches and Frontlines**  
  A caern is not just sacred—it is a fortress.  
  Losing one is like losing a piece of Gaia herself.

- **Theological Doubt**  
  The "agreement" with the Sabbat shakes faith to its core.  
  Some Garou whisper that by standing beside the undead, they risk becoming the very corruption they are sworn to fight.  
  Others argue that desperate times demand desperate measures.

**Player Tip:**  
Exploring these themes through your character's struggles, choices, and sacrifices will define your place in the unfolding story of Eastern Tennessee.

## Final Thought

The Garou of Eastern Tennessee stand at the edge of a precipice.

Surrounded by corruption, outnumbered by enemies, and burdened by uneasy "agreement"s, they fight not just for survival — they fight for the soul of the Earth itself.

You are not a bystander.  
You are Gaia's warrior, born of fang, spirit, and fury.  
You carry the weight of generations past and the hope of generations yet unborn.

Every battle you fight, every choice you make, and every rite you perform echoes across the spiritual landscape.  
You are part of a story far larger than yourself — a story of loyalty, sacrifice, betrayal, and redemption.

The Wyrm's touch spreads. The Sabbat cannot be trusted forever. The land calls for champions who will not break under pressure, who will not sell their honor for temporary safety.

The question is not whether you will fight.

The question is: **What will you become in the fight?**

**Your mission is clear:**  
Protect Gaia. Defend the sacred. Purge the Wyrm.

Do not lose your soul along the way.

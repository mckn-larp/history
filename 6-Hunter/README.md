# Hunters of Eastern Tennessee

---

## Overview

Hunters in Eastern Tennessee are awakening to a truth far more complex than any cryptid legend or ghost story. Once isolated defenders of their towns and traditions, these individuals are now part of a hidden war between ancient supernatural factions—Sabbat vampires, Garou, wraiths, Fae, and the corrupting power of the Wyrm. Whether motivated by faith, vengeance, duty, or curiosity, each hunter group brings a different philosophy and strategy to the battlefield.

### Major Groups of Hunters

**The Vigil Keepers**  
Once rooted in rural militia movements, these defenders have evolved into tight-knit, Appalachian survivalists. Religious, resourceful, and determined, they focus on community protection. Most are unaware of the full supernatural war but are slowly being drawn deeper into its mysteries.

**Order of the Holy Flame**  
Fanatical and focused, this faith-driven group sees their mission as holy. Vampires, spirits, and Wyrm-tainted creatures are abominations to be purged. Their worldview is rigid—alliances are rare, and their actions are often blunt but powerful.

**The Lantern Society**  
A secretive organization of supernatural investigators and lore keepers. They operate from Knoxville and are the most well-informed of the hunter factions. They prioritize balance, knowledge, and diplomacy, sometimes even working with supernatural beings.

**Project Blackthorn**  
A covert government task force based out of Oak Ridge. Originally formed for anti-terrorism, the project has turned its focus to the supernatural. Armed with cutting-edge tech and government backing, they straddle the line between science and the occult.

**Watchers of the Lost Light**  
Spiritual hunters who see their mission as preserving the balance between worlds. Deeply attuned to the land, Umbra, and Dreaming, they ally with Garou and Nunnehi when possible. They seek harmony, not domination.

**Independent Hunters**  
Wanderers like Carter “Shade” Matthews, who operate alone or in temporary teams. They follow personal codes and vendettas, often working on the edge of hunter society.

### Objectives

Each hunter group has its own focus:

- **Vigil Keepers:** Defend rural areas, now adapting to Wyrm and Sabbat threats.
- **Order of the Holy Flame:** Purge all supernatural evil in the name of faith.
- **Lantern Society:** Investigate and map the supernatural landscape. Avoid unnecessary conflict.
- **Project Blackthorn:** Control, contain, and neutralize supernatural threats using federal resources.
- **Watchers of the Lost Light:** Preserve spiritual balance. Prevent any faction from seizing too much power.
- **Independent Hunters:** Survive. Kill what needs killing. Walk alone.

### Key Allies and Enemies

**Allies**

- **Local Law Enforcement:** Especially SED agents with growing suspicions.
- **Uktena Garou:** Shared defense against the Wyrm.
- **Nunnehi:** Strategic spiritual allies for those who earn their trust.
- **Clergy:** Offer support, sanctuaries, and divine justification (especially to the Order).

**Enemies**

- **Sabbat:** Ruthless, organized vampires are the primary targets in Knoxville.
- **Wyrm-Tainted Entities:** Black Spiral Dancers, corrupted spirits, and polluted land are a shared threat.
- **Unseelie Court:** Particularly manipulative and dangerous in the tourist districts.
- **Technocracy:** Especially in Oak Ridge and Kingston—conducting dangerous experiments.

**Neutral/Mixed**

- **Wraiths:** Not always hostile. Some may aid hunters in resisting the Wyrm.
- **Other Garou Tribes:** Some see hunters as a threat to the Veil.

### Key Locations

- **The Ridge Line Bunker:** Vigil Keepers’ Appalachian stronghold.
- **The Holy Flame Citadel:** Faith-driven fortress outside Knoxville.
- **The Lantern Lodge:** Urban research base for paranormal investigations.
- **The Lost Light Refuge:** Hidden forest retreat for spiritual hunters.
- **The Blackthorn Facility:** Federal facility with tech and secrets buried deep.
- **The Crossroads Sanctuary:** Neutral zone for independent hunters.

### Known Hunting Grounds

- **Oak Ridge:** Ground zero for Wyrm-taint and Technocratic experiments.
- **Cades Cove:** Sacred Garou ground; high tension.
- **Old St. Mary’s Hospital:** Haunted hospital full of wraith activity.
- **Pigeon Forge/Gatlinburg:** Fae intrigue beneath the tourist glitz.
- **Cherokee National Forest:** Mystical battleground for spirits, Garou, and hunters.
- **Knoxville Industrial District:** Sabbat stronghold and hunter combat zone.

### Key Figures

- **John “Ironhand” McCormick (Vigil Keepers):** Veteran of local supernatural warfare.
- **Sister Maria Helene (Order of the Holy Flame):** Holy warrior and spiritual crusader.
- **Dr. Evelyn Connors (Lantern Society):** Academic turned occult investigator.
- **Colonel Robert “Blackthorn” Graves (Project Blackthorn):** Military leader with access to vast resources.
- **Grace “Whisper” Vance (Watchers):** Umbra-walker and spirit diplomat.
- **Carter “Shade” Matthews:** Lone mercenary on a personal warpath.

### Themes

**Political:**  
Tensions between isolationist groups (Vigil Keepers, Order) and more integrated ones (Lantern Society, Watchers). Project Blackthorn operates with shadowy autonomy and unclear government motives.

**Social:**  
Tight-knit hunter cultures clash with outsiders and supernatural beings. Trust is rare, and ideology divides groups as much as it unites them.

**Economic:**  
Most groups operate on donations, barter, or covert funding. Project Blackthorn enjoys government resources. Independent hunters fund themselves through mercenary work.

**Religion and Belief:**  
From divine missions to secular reasoning to spiritual harmony—each group has its own compass. These beliefs guide how they view supernatural beings: enemies, allies, or necessary evils.

### Summary

Hunters in Eastern Tennessee are no longer just shadowy defenders of forgotten towns. They are now players in a supernatural war of terrifying scope. Whether through faith, research, or force of arms, they must now decide what role they will play—isolated slayers, balanced mediators, or soldiers in an apocalyptic crusade.

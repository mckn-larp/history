# Wraiths of Eastern Tennessee

---

## Overview

Eastern Tennessee is one of the most haunted regions in America, and Knoxville stands at the center of it. The Shadowlands here are dense with the spirits of those who met tragic ends—Native peoples displaced in the Trail of Tears, soldiers of the Civil War, miners lost to industrial disaster, and forgotten dead from Knoxville’s urban decay. These wraiths are bound to the places where their stories ended and often clash with living supernaturals who threaten their fragile existence.

Wraiths in Knoxville range from vengeful spirits seeking justice to guardians of sacred land, and even to corrupted Spectres twisted by the Wyrm’s influence. While they are no longer enslaved by the Giovanni, they are not free from peril. The spiritual war involving the Wyrm, Sabbat, and Garou continues to spill over into the Shadowlands, creating dangerous currents of unrest and transformation.

## Necropoli

### Oak Ridge Necropolis
A volatile and corrupted Necropolis built on the spiritual wounds left by the Manhattan Project. Many wraiths here are Spectres, driven mad by radiation and Wyrm-taint.

### Old St. Mary’s Hospital
This former hospital in downtown Knoxville is haunted by the ghosts of patients and doctors. The hospital is filled with unresolved pain, and wraiths here often seek revenge or closure.

### Cade’s Cove Necropolis
Tucked in the Smoky Mountains, this spiritual refuge houses ancient wraiths from indigenous tribes and early settlers. They are territorial, protective of the land, and suspicious of intruders.

## Objectives

- **Restore Stability in the Shadowlands:** Wraiths seek to rebuild what was lost in the Great Maelstrom and protect their domains from Spectres and supernatural incursion.
- **Protect Sacred Sites:** Wraiths of Cade’s Cove and similar areas are focused on defending sacred, spiritual ground from the Wyrm’s corruption and mortal exploitation.
- **Resolve Unfinished Business:** From justice-seeking doctors to betrayed souls, many wraiths are tied to unresolved mortal ties.
- **Survive Spectral Warfare:** The rise of Spectres—Wyrm-corrupted wraiths—means every wraith must now fight for both survival and spiritual integrity.

## Allies and Enemies

- **Sabbat:** While no longer enslaving wraiths like the Giovanni did, their rituals often disrupt spiritual sites. Some necromancers offer temporary alliances.
- **Garou:** Occasionally aligned in their shared fight against the Wyrm, but tensions flare over spiritual territory. Garou often see wraiths as unnatural.
- **Spectres and the Wyrm:** These are the main enemies of most wraiths. Spectres attack Necropoli and spread corruption wherever they go.
- **Necromancers and Occultists:** Characters like Inese Ozolins work with wraiths pragmatically, offering protection or resources in exchange for occult knowledge.

## Major Events

- **The Great Maelstrom (1999):** This catastrophic event shattered many wraith communities. Survivors are now trying to rebuild what was lost.
- **Fall of the Giovanni:** With the Giovanni’s influence broken, wraiths are no longer enslaved but face a dangerous new political landscape.
- **Arrival of the Harbingers of Skulls:** These Sabbat necromancers are not interested in domination but want to tap into wraith knowledge. Wraiths are divided on whether they’re a threat or a resource.

## Points of Interest

- **Tunnels of Oak Ridge:** Dangerous, Spectre-infested haunt where twisted spirits from nuclear experiments linger.
- **Old St. Mary’s Hospital:** A central haunt in Knoxville, filled with sorrowful ghosts caught between rage and redemption.
- **Cade’s Cove:** Sacred and protected haunt, home to powerful and ancient spirits trying to shield the land from corruption.
- **Wears Valley and Townsend:** Rural zones with scattered, haunted hot spots—ideal for lone wraiths or small cabals.

## Key Figures

- **Ellie Runningdeer:** Protector of Cade’s Cove, deeply spiritual, and violently opposed to Spectres and Wyrm-tainted forces.
- **Dr. Emil Reeves:** Haunts Old St. Mary’s, torn between guilt and dominance. Occasionally allies with Sabbat necromancers.
- **Maggie “Three Crows” Lewis:** A powerful Spectre who rules the Oak Ridge tunnels. She represents the worst aspects of Wyrm corruption.
- **Inese Ozolins:** Sabbat necromancer interested in cooperation over domination. Wraiths who work with her gain protection, but often at a cost.

## Thematic Tropes

### Political
Wraith politics are in flux. Freed from the Giovanni, local Necropoli now struggle for control. The presence of Sabbat necromancers, Garou interference, and Spectres threatens any attempt at stable governance.

### Social
Fragmented and traumatized, wraiths forge bonds out of necessity rather than trust. Guilds are diminished but still operate as social frameworks.

### Economic
Wraiths deal in artifacts, soulforged relics, and forbidden secrets. The arrival of the Harbingers has added occult knowledge and barter to this spiritual economy.

### Religion
Religion for wraiths revolves around honoring the dead and preserving the afterlife’s balance. Their conflicts with Spectres are not only survival-based but spiritual—seen as a war for the soul of death itself.
